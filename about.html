        <p>
            This website was created to showcase some of my favorite and most iconic Mario characters and to give more of a peak into the Mario
            universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            I picked Mario characters because I grew up with Mario games, and all of these Mario characters are in Super
            Smash Bros. Ultimate, which is a game that I play a lot. I mostly kept the styling simple, with some basic cards, but also added a blurred
            background image to make the site stand out a bit more.
